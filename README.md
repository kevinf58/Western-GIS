## About This Project
This project was done with 3 other classmates to simulate a software development process using Confluence, Jira, and BitBucket over the duration of 3 months. Together, we created a software to provide end users and developers with a number of functions:
### End Users
 - Allow users to log into their account (Account credentials were stored locally in JSON format)
 - View a guide on how to use the application
 - View the floor maps of various different buildings at UWO
 - View the details of each room on a floor including name, description, room type (washroom, elevator, computer lab, lecture hall, etc)
 - Search for a specific room type with ease using a tree pane or a search bar
 - Save points of interest that users may have and allow them to add descriptions to each one added
 - Save their favourite rooms

### Developers
 - Allow developers to log into their developer account
 - Perform the same tasks as a standard end user
 - Add, delete, and modify building room types

The "project_management.zip" file contains all documented information for the group project. This includes meeting minutes, team contract, design documentation, requirements documentation, diagrams, UI mockup, and much more.
